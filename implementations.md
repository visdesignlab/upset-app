# Implementations of UpSet

The basic idea of UpSet has been implemented many times. Here we list the available implementations and describe their main benefits and drawbacks. 

We distinguish between three-types of implementations: 

* **Interactive Tools** that are meant for uploading data and customizing the plot dynamically, without programming. 

* **Plotting Libraries** that are designed to be customized in a programming language, e.g., in R or Python and can be used as part of a computational notebook, or can be integrated in a larger system. Some of these tools also have interactive wrappers, using e.g., R-Shiny so that they can be used without programming. 

* **Sample Implementations** demonstrate how to implement an UpSet plot in a framework (e.g., Tableau) but are not libraries and hence typically don't have data loading capabilities and are tested only with a single dataset. It's usually possible to copy a template and customize it to work with your own data.
